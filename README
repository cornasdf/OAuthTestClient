OAuthTestClient
===============

The OAuthTestClient is a java based GUI application that acts as an OAuth 
2.0 "Client".  

GOALS

   * Provide a simple GUI based test client that will allow OAuth 2.0 users
     to learn how an OAuth 2.0 conversation works.
   * Provide a non-browser based implementation so that interaction with a 
     User Agent can be demonstrated.
   * Support all grant types and tokens.
   * Display as much of the OAuth conversatio to the user as possible.
   * Allow the user to modify parameters to try out negative test cases (for 
     example: requesting a protected resource with an invalid access token.)


HISTORY

   I wrote this application for a colleague at Layer 7 Technologies so that he
   could demonstrate an OAuth flow to a potential customer.  Although it is simple, 
   I thought it might be useful for others, so I'm sharing it via github.  


DEPENDENCIES

    * Java 1.6
    * An existing OAuth 2.0 service to test against

BINARY

   I've included a runnable jar file in the bin directory, but I can't guarantee
   that it will always be up to date with the source code.

THIRD PARTY CODE

    This package uses the following code libraries:

    * NanoHTTPD (http://elonen.iki.fi/code/nanohttpd/) - Jarno Elonen's embedded
      HTTP server for Java
    * The Java based JSON parser provide by JSON.org (http://www.json.org/java/)
